# Trump financial disclosure data

The Center for Public Integrity is releasing spreadsheet versions of President Donald Trump's financial disclosures filed in [2016](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2838696-Trump-2016-Financial-Disclosure.html) and [2017](https://oge.app.box.com/s/kz4qvbdsbcfrzq16msuo4zmth6rerh1c). These were extracted from PDFs using Tabula and painstakingly cleaned up in Google Sheets by several people, including, but not limited to, Chris Zubak-Skees, Iuliia Alieva and Carrie Levine.

## A word of caution

Though a lot of effort has gone into cleaning these sheets, the resulting data may not be perfect. The sheets remain formatted as close to the disclosure as possible, which is not always conducive to data analysis. Not every piece of information in the disclosure was included, certain additional items have yet to be digitized. What's included and the [timeframe each section of the disclosure covers](https://www.oge.gov/Web/278eGuide.nsf/2cf9ac792bc0654a85257ea1005f838a/5df300cba7fca98485257f450074e3a4?OpenDocument) is not always what you'd expect. And minor mistakes introduced in the conversion process may still be possible. Please double check against the original PDFs if you're at all unsure. And if you spot a problem, or want to contribute, feel free to file a pull request, open an issue or email czubakskees@publicintegrity.org.
